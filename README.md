# Build the world with code

This repository serves as the basis for my tutorials series that connects several aspects of deploying an app in a world where everything is managed with code.

The following chapters are contained

1. [Infrastructure as code](01-infrastructure-as-code/index.md): We will look at how basic infrastructure like servers and networks can be managed and deployed with code in a cloud like environment
2. [Platform as code](02-platform-as-code/index.md): We will deploy our own docker orchestrator with code.
3. [Execution environment as code](03-execution-as-code/index.md): We will learn how docker codifies execution environments for software and how to employ this knowledge to simply complex build processes.
4. [Deployment as code](04-deployment-as-code/index.md): Finally we will look at how to deploy an app into a kubernetes cluster using helm charts.
